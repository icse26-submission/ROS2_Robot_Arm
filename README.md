# ROS2 Controller Repair

## Description

This dirrecory contains an example implementation of N-version Automated Program Repair.
It is implemented on a robot arm control system written using ROS2. This robotic arm simulation comes from https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/tree/master/example_7.

The `vulns/` dirrectory contains example vulnerable controller code and input generators to exploit them. 
So far, we have successfully repaired: `vuln_segfault`,`vuln_fmtstr_crash`, `vuln_dos`, `bug_floating_point`, and `vuln_infinite_loop`.

The detection mechanism leverages a mallicious controller voting against the N-version system concesus. The failing test cases for the repair are drawn from cases where the failing controller votted incorrectly. A successful repair will generate a patch file `patches/0.diff` which can be applied to the failing controller to make it pass all generated tests (i.e. the patched controller ***would*** have voted correctly before).

Thus, we can react to threats and dynamically generate test cases that expose them in the targeted controller. Then, we can use these generated tests to automatically craft a repair that addresses the threat.


## Darjeeling Dependency

In order to run a repair, you must install Darjeeling from https://github.com/squaresLab/Darjeeling/.
This project is designed to use commit 811337bc15186f0eaf49a4d15fb09441add2ff38.
Follow the dirrections given in the repository to install the dependencies and set up the pip environment. Then, update the path to Darjeeling
in the repair.sh file in this directory.


## Setup

Must be on Ubuntu 22.04 or higher for this to work. Has only been tested on Ubuntu 24.04.
```
./install_ros2_jazzy.sh     # or install ros2 jazzy manually using the dirrections at
                            #       https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html
./copy_vuln.sh safe
./build.sh
```

## Running an example

```
[copy a vulnerability into controller 0 and rebuild everything]
rm -rf log/ build/ install/
./copy_vuln.sh [name of vuln]
./build.sh
./build_controllers.sh

[start a workspace]
source ./source_workspace.sh

[in one workspace]
./start_controllers.sh
[in a second workspace]
./controller.sh
[in a third workspace]
python3 voter.py
[in a fourth workspace]
./send_trajectory.sh

[once a vulnerability is detected]
./repair.sh <controller num> <idx>
```
Here, the `controller num` means which controller to repair (./copy_vuln.sh makes controller 0 vulnerable) and `idx` refers to the highest index reached by the controllers. This will be reported as "My Index" in the output of voter.py and "Idx recieved" in the output of ./start_controller.sh. It can also be clearly seen by running `ls results` and choosing the largest index present.

Repairs can also be triggered automatically by commenting out line 134 in voter.py. This allows the remaining N-1 controllers to maintain opperation durring the repair.
```

[afterwards]
./cleanup.sh
```

## Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `bug_oob_array_access` | Off-by-one array access (`<=` instead of `<`) |
| `bug_type_casting` | Incorrect type casting in delta calculation |
| `bug_type_casting_2` | Unnecessary type casting in interpolation |
| `bug_floating_point` | Floating Point Exception from accidental divizion by 0 |
| `bug_interpolate_half_always` | Mathematical mistake. Always uses midpoint instead of scaling by delta |
| `vuln_stack_bof` | Stack buffer overflow in acceleration processing |
| `vuln_segfault` | Null pointer dereference in feature allowing inspecting memory |
| `vuln_infinite_loop` | Loop that increments but doesn't check negative values |
| `vuln_heap_bof` | Heap buffer overflow progressively corrupting more chunk metadata |
| `vuln_uaf` | Use-after-free between acceleration/effort processing |
| `vuln_fmtstr_crash` | Format string vulnerability reading invalid memory |
| `vuln_fmtstr_leak` | Format string vulnerability leaking stack data |
| `vuln_uaf` | Use after free error |

### Reference Implementations
